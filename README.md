E-Commerce Website (MERN Stack)
This is a full-stack e-commerce website built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project consists of three main components:

Frontend: A React-based user interface for customers to browse products, manage their cart, and complete purchases.
Backend: A Node.js Express server that handles the business logic, user authentication, product management, and payment gateway integration.
Admin Panel: A React-based interface for administrators to manage products, view orders, and handle users.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three main folders:

frontend/: The React-based client-side application.
backend/: The Node.js server-side application.
admin/: The React-based admin panel.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (for database)
npm or yarn for package management


Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>


Here is a sample README for your MERN stack e-commerce website that includes the frontend, backend, and admin panel. This will provide users with information on how to set up and run the project, along with any relevant dependencies and instructions.

Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>

2. Setting up the backend:
Navigate to the backend/ folder and install the necessary dependencies.
cd backend
npm install

Next, set up your environment variables by creating a .env file in the backend/ folder with the following (you may need to update the values according to your environment):

MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
CLOUDINARY_URL=your-cloudinary-url
RAZORPAY_KEY=your-razorpay-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key


3. Running the backend:
To start the backend server in development mode, run:
npm run server
This will start the backend on http://localhost:5000.

4. Setting up the frontend:
Navigate to the frontend/ folder and install the dependencies.
cd frontend
npm install

5. Running the frontend:
To start the frontend development server, run:
npm run dev
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.

6. Setting up the admin panel:
Navigate to the admin/ folder and install the dependencies.
cd admin
npm install

7. Running the admin panel:
To start the admin panel development server, run:
npm run dev
This will start the admin panel on http://localhost:4000.

Scripts
Frontend
npm run dev: Run the development server for the frontend (Vite).
npm run build: Build the frontend for production.
npm run lint: Run ESLint to check for code quality issues.
npm run preview: Preview the production build locally.

Backend
npm run server: Start the backend server with node.
npm run start: Start the backend server without nodemon (useful for production).
npm run lint: Lint backend code.

Admin Panel
npm run dev: Run the development server for the admin panel (Vite).
npm run build: Build the admin panel for production.
npm run lint: Run ESLint to check for code quality issues.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, React Router, Axios, React Toastify
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, Multer, Razorpay, Stripe, Cloudinary
Admin Panel: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Axios

Troubleshooting
CORS issues: Ensure your backend is running with CORS enabled. If there are issues with CORS, verify that the correct headers are set on your Express server.
Payment Integration: Check that your Razorpay and Stripe keys are correctly set in the .env files.
